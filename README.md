<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

### How to run this project:

This project uses the Pnpm package manager. To run the project in a development environment:

``` bash
pnpm dev
```

This project publishes to github pages that references the `master` branch.
On the `master` branch you need to build the project using `predeploy` command:

``` bash
pnpm run predeploy
```

Then on the `master` branch run deploy to publish to github:

``` bash
pnpm deploy
```
